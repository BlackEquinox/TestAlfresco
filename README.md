## Description

- run tests: `protractor conf.js`

## Explanation
These tests are using Page Object as a most common pattern. Everything else is pretty straight forward. 
Some solutions might not be ideal generally (for example getPageSource) - but I found it a simple working solution which should ne enough in scope of these tests. 

Thanks for taking your time to look through it and have a nice day ;)
